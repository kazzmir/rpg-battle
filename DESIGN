world creation:
  fill a bunch of areas using the shape of a circle using a floating point number from 0 to 1. then average out every tile in the world using a nearest neighbor calculation. after a few averaging passes any circles that were close enough together should merge, creating bridges between land masses. assign land tiles based on the final value of land.

  0.4 - 1: normal land
  0.2 - 0.4: beach
  0.0 - 0.2: water

once land is in place then add mountain ranges, rivers, etc.
